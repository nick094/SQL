1) SELECT * FROM employees AS em INNER JOIN job_history AS jh 
 ON (em.employee_id = jh.department_id) ;
2) 
SELECT C.country_name, R.region_name
FROM countries AS C INNER JOIN regions AS R ;

SELECT region_name, country_name
FROM regions NATURAL JOIN countries; правильный ответ

3) SELECT*FROM countries INNER JOIN locations USING (country_id); 

4) SELECT first_name,last_name,new.job_id, previous.job_id FROM employees AS new  
INNER JOIN job_history AS previous USING (employee_id);

SELECT first_name, last_name, e.job_id AS new, jh.job_id AS previous FROM employees AS e 
INNER JOIN job_history AS jh ON(e.employee_id = jh.employee_id); правильный ответ

5) SELECT first_name,last_name,country_id FROM employees CROSS JOIN countries;

6) SELECT*FROM employees AS em LEFT JOIN job_history AS jh ON (em.employee_id= jh.employee_id);

7) SELECT*FROM countries INNER JOIN locations USING (country_id ) ;

SELECT * FROM countries AS c LEFT JOIN locations AS l ON(c.country_id = l.country_id)
UNION
SELECT * FROM countries AS c RIGHT JOIN locations AS l ON(c.country_id = l.country_id)

10) SELECT l.country_id, COUNT(*) FROM locations AS l INNER JOIN countries AS c ON(l.country_id=c.country_id)
INNER JOIN regions AS r ON(c.region_id=r.region_id)
GROUP BY l.country_id
ORDER BY COUNT(*);

ИЛИ

SELECT locations.country_id, COUNT(*) FROM locations
